## Endpoints available for authenticated users (authenticated, admins)

As was described above, we enabled JWT authentication in our service. If you signed up in our service, you can sign in here by obtaining a pair of access and refresh tokens to be able to work with our service.

For better experience we created our own header naming like `Authorize`. To use in browsable api, Postman or Swagger documentation, make sure add prefix `Bearer` before value of access token. For adding header in browser, you can use extension [ModHeader](https://modheader.com/).

Obtain a pair of tokens you can using `POST /api/user/token/`. Make sure provide in body your credentials (email and password).

Response example: 

```json
{
    "refresh": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTc0MDk5Njc3MiwiaWF0IjoxNzQwOTEwMzcyLCJqdGkiOiIwZmVjNDEyOWY4ZmQ0NmUyYmI4MmE5Y2Q4MjYxMmE0MyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.o9O4nkPuwHtjfJocvxSJTJ2YBhYy7P8FROUYYqwMmN4",
    "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2MDk0MzcyLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5MTAzNzIsImp0aSI6IjYyMDRhMTU3MWYwZDQ1YzdiYzJhZTYyZjJiMmEyOTRhIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MX0.oDjAedU9d1iG5IoUJqrjroLM2DoqMZ7WFTt2felutv8"
}
```

After obtaining this pair of token, you can refresh access token using refresh token. To do it, use this endpoint `POST /api/user/token/refresh/` and make sure provide value of refresh token in body of request.

Response example:

```json
{
    "access": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2MDk0NTUwLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA5MTAzNzIsImp0aSI6IjM0ZGI2M2M2N2U5ZDQzNmJiZjhiYmMyZDFlYzM5NGFkIiwidXNlcl9pZCI6MX0.8xADPrM3xJW4Pj8Gu4pa5FkzKWj2uxvN3gd29ylYXKM"
}
```

Also, you can verify your tokens via `POST /api/user/token/verify/`. Make sure provide in body of request value of token.

Response example in success:

```json
{}
```
Response example in failure:

```json
{
    "detail": "Token is invalid",
    "code": "token_not_valid"
}
```

To have access to endpoints as authenticated user:

##### In browser use ModHeader:

![img.png](img.png)

1) Add header `Authorize`
2) Enable it via checkpoint.
3) Provide value of access token like this: `Bearer access_token_value`.

##### In Postman:

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

1) Go to Headers tab.
2) Add header `Authorize` in key column. It will automatically enable it.
3) Provide value of access token like this: `Bearer access_token_value`. 

### Work with user's profile:

`GET /api/user/me/` - Allows users to see information about their own profile.

Response example:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "first_name": "string",
    "last_name": "string"
}
```

`PUT /api/user/me/` - Allows users to edit their profile. (Values should be provided for all fields.)

`PATCH /api/user/me/` - Allows users to edit their profile partly. (Users can edit some specific values only or whole info.)

### Book borrowing:

`GET /api/library/borrowings/` - here users can see list of all borrowings they did.

Response example:

```json

    {
        "id": 2,

        "expected_return_date": "2025-03-07",
        "actual_return_date": null,
        "book": "1984",
        "is_active": true
    },
    {
        "id": 1,

        "expected_return_date": "2025-03-05",
        "actual_return_date": "2025-03-01",
        "book": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",
        "is_active": false
    }
]
```

`GET /api/library/borrowings/<int:pk>/` - here users can see information about one of their borrowings.

##### Filter borrowing by status
`GET /api/library/borrowings/?is_active=true` - allows to filter borrowings by status. For active borrowings you should provide values like `True`, `true` or `1`. Everything else will be taken as False.

To borrow book, users should use `POST /api/library/borrowings/`. Make sure to provide expected return data and id of book you will borrow in body of request.
As result users will receive redirect url to make payment via Stripe.

Response example:

```json
{
    "redirect_url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_a1TuKbJHpO90smzdnfrnh48bgysdfnudsoigmdfuugbJHBTYBtrdewtyfyergrey7gtwevrdtrwffdunegftrbytftr5decf"
}
```

When user click on that url, it will redirect them to page like that to make payment:

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

After pay for borrowing, it will redirect you here:

`GET /api/payment/stripe/success/?session_id=cs_test_a1yWuGCysdjfnduigidfngfuihbEhM`

Where you will see information about successful payment:

```json
{
    "message": "Payment successful",
    "borrowing_id": 4
}
```

    "message": "Payment was cancelled. You can try again."
}
```

Provide necessary information to pay for borrowing. (**Attention!** url for payment will be active only 24 hours.)

To return book you should use `POST /api/library/borrowings/<int:pk>/return/`. Make sure provide expected return data and id of book you will borrow in body of request. After that your borrowing will become inactive. If you return book later than expected return data, you should to pay fine for delaying.
